If this is the first time you will compile Torque 3D, or if you have added or removed any files to either the standard Torque 3D *Engine/source* directory or your project's *source* directory, you will need to run your project's *generateProjects.bat* file.  This will rebuild your project's solution and project files.  Now follow these steps to compile Torque 3D:

1. Navigate to your project's *buildFiles/VisualStudio 2010* directory (or the *2008* directory if that is the version of Visual Studio you are using).
2. Double click on your project's .sln file.  This will open Visual Studio.
3. When Visual Studio has fully loaded, press `F7` to start compiling your project.
