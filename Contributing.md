Branches
--------
There are two branches: *master* and *development*.  The *master* branch contains the current stable version of Torque 3D.  The *development* branch is where all work is done prior to it being moved to the *master* branch as determined by the Steering Committee.

Using the development branch
----------------------------
To start using the *development* branch you will need to create your own fork of the repository:

1. Create your own fork of the Torque 3D repository by using the **Fork** button on GitHub.
2. Check out the *development* branch from the Git command line: `git checkout development`
3. Add an upstream remote: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D.git`

To pull changes from the GarageGames/Torque3D *development* branch into your developer fork: `git pull upstream development`

To submit your changes back to the GarageGames/Torque3D *development* branch, use the **Pull Request** page from GitHub to make a request from your fork into the *development* branch.
