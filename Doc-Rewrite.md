Creating a New Project Based on a Template
------------------------------------------

The templates included with Torque 3D provide a starting point for your project.  Once we have created our own project based on a template we may then compile an executable and begin work on our game.  The following templates are included in this version of Torque 3D:

* Empty
* Empty PhysX
* Full
* Full PhysX

The *Project Manager* may be used to create a new game project based on one of the templates that are included with Torque 3D.  If you are using Torque 3D directly from the GitHub repository then you will need to get the *Project Manager* from the [Torque3D-ProjectManager](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D-ProjectManager) repo.

The following steps use the *Project Manager* to create a new project:

1. Run the *Project Manager*.
2. Click the *New Project* button.
3. Choose a template from the drop down on the right.
4. Give the project a name.
5. Click the *Create* button to create the project.  This will open a new dialog window that shows the progress.
6. When it finishes, click the *Finished* button.
7. You may click on the *Open Folder* button to go to the project's directory.



Compiling Torque 3D
-------------------

If you are going to be using a PhysX template, then you will need to complete this step. Otherwise, you can go to 2a.

1. Install the PhysX SDK version 2.8.4.6.  
  * In a web browser, go to the NVidia Support Center (http://supportcenteronline.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=1949)
  * If you do not have an account, you will need to register with them to have the support staff create an account for you.
  * If you have an account, login.
  * On the middle of the page, on the right, click on Downloads.
  * On the far right column, under Old downloads, click More.
  * Download the Windows 2.8.4.6 version.
  * Run the installer and follow the steps to install it in the default location.
  * Depending on your operating system version, you may need to reboot after the installation.

2a. Creating a New Game Project - With Toolbox
  * Run the Torque 3D Toolbox.
  * Click New Project.
  * Choose a base template.
  * Name the Project.
  * Click Create to create the project.
  * When it finishes, click the Finished button.

2b. Creating a New Game Project - Manually
  * Open the Templates directory.
  * Right-click and copy the template that you want to use.
  * Navigate to the directory where you want to develop your game.
  * Paste inside of that directory to copy the files.
  * Open the game directory.
  * Rename the executable and DLL files to the name of your game (for example, rename Full.exe to MyGame.exe if you used the Full template).
  * Rename the plugin's in the same way, replacing the template name with your game's name.
  * Inside your project directory, double-click the generateProjects.bat file.
  * It will create the solutions.
 
3. Compiling Torque 3D
  * Navigate to engine\build\Visual Studio 2010
  * Double-click the Torque 3D.sln file.
  * When Visual Studio 2010 is fully loaded, press F5 to perform a clean build.
