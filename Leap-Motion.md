The [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) controller allows for hands and fingers to provide input to an application.  With commit SHA: 27a81f9c0da8c10fc406a451022f01fc41265fb7 the *development* branch now has preliminary support for this new input device.

### Making Use of the Leap Motion Controller in Your Project ###

Before you can make use of the Leap Motion controller in Torque 3D you will need to download the Leap Motion SDK from their web site and extract it to a convienent directory.  As of this writing you need to be invited into their developer program in order to gain access to their SDK.

With the SDK in place, you will need to modify your project's `buildFiles/config/project.conf` file in a text editor.
