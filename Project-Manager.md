The Torque 3D *Project Manager* is an optional utility that helps you create new projects based on Torque 3D Templates as well as manage existing projects.

## Where to Find the Project Manager
The *Project Manager* may be downloaded from here: ???  Just follow the instructions in its *ReadMe* file on where to install it.  (All versions of the Project Manager may be found here: [Project Manager Archive](Project-Manager-Archive))

If you wish to instead compile from source, head over to the *Project Manager* repository: [Torque3D-ProjectManager](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D-ProjectManager)  It uses [Qt 4.8.x](http://qt-project.org/downloads) for its interface so you will need to obtain that first.

## Create a New Project From a Template
Torque 3D has a number of *Templates* that may be used as a starting point for your own project.  The *Project Manager* makes it easy to create new projects from these *Templates*.  Begin by launching *Project Manager.exe*.

From here you may give your project a new name and choose which *Template* will be copied to your project.  Torque 3D is also made up of a number of optional modules that may be compiled into the code base.  These modules may determine which physics library will be used, or that a particular input device will be supported.  To choose which modules will be included with your project you click on the *Choose Modules* button.

From this window you select which modules you want to include and click on the *OK* button.  Please see the **Using the Project Modules Windows** section below for more information on using this window.

With your new project now all set up you click on the *Create* button.  A new window will open informing you of the project creation progress which includes copying the files from the chosen *Template*, configuring all of the project's files, and generating the project's solution for compiling.  Your project is now ready to be turned into your game!

## Modifying an Existing Project's Modules
You may change which optional modules are compiled into your project at any time.  This is done from the main *Project Manager* window by first selecting your project and then clicking on the *Modules* button.

**NOTE: Prior to changing any modules, be sure to close your project's solution in Visual Studio**

This will open the *Project Modules* window.  From here you may make changes to which modules or move class will be used by your project.

After you have made your changes you click on the *Regenerate* button.  This will automatically regenerate your project's solution files, and your project may be recompiled.  For more information on using the *Project Modules* window please see the next section.
