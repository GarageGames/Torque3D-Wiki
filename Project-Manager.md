The Torque 3D *Project Manager* is an optional utility that helps you create new projects based on Torque 3D Templates as well as manage existing projects.

## Where to Find the Project Manager
The *Project Manager* may be downloaded from here: ???  Just follow the instructions in its *ReadMe* file on where to install it.  (All versions of the Project Manager may be found here: [Project Manager Archive](Project-Manager-Archive))

If you wish to instead compile from source, head over to the *Project Manager* repository: [Torque3D-ProjectManager](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D-ProjectManager)  It uses [Qt 4.8.x](http://qt-project.org/downloads) for its interface so you will need to obtain that first.

## Create a New Project From a Template
Torque 3D has a number of *Templates* that may be used as a starting point for your own project.  The *Project Manager* makes it easy to create new projects from these *Templates*.  Begin by launching *Project Manager.exe*.
