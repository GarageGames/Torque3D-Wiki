The Torque 3D *Project Manager* is an optional utility that helps you create new projects based on Torque 3D Templates as well as manage existing projects.

## Where to Find the Project Manager
The *Project Manager* may be downloaded from here: ???  Just follow the instructions in its *ReadMe* file on where to install it.

If you wish to instead compile from source, head over to the *Project Manager* repository: [Torque3D-ProjectManager](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D-ProjectManager)  It uses [Qt 4.8.x](http://qt-project.org/downloads) for its interface so you will need to obtain that first.
