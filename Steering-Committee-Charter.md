If a member is unable to serve on the committee for any reason, the vacancy may be filled or left empty at the discretion of the committee.

## 5. Reports
To facilitate the committee’s operation while accounting for members in varied timezones, reports are the primary method of internal communication. At the end of the month, each committee member will summarize their activity into a monthly work report in a publicly available format. 

## 6. Voting
Any actions to be undertaken by members of the committee in an official capacity should be voted on where there is any disagreement. Voting will take place in forum threads, emails, or any other appropriate method of communication available to all members. Each member of the committee has one vote. Any member who has not voted seven days after the vote is initiated will count as having abstained. Decisions must be approved by a two-thirds majority of all members (not only members who participate in the vote).
